<h1>Redland RDF Application Framework Bindings - Building and Installing from Source</h1>


<h2>1. Get pre-requisites</h2>

<p>The Redland Bindings require a previously built and installed
Redland package with the same version number.  In particular, the
header files, shared libraries and SWIG interface files that Redland
provides are required for most language bindings.  An alternative to
installation is to extract the Redland sources in a parent directory
or a sibling directory called 'librdf'.</p>


<h2>2. Getting the sources</h2>

<p>There are several ways to get the sources.  The most stable and
tested versions are the sources shipped with each release and these
are recommended as the first place to start.  If you want to get a
newer set, then there are nightly snapshots made of the development
sources, which may not yet be committed to the CVS.  For the latest
developent sources, anonymous CVS access is available but this may
require some configuring of developer tools that are not needed for
the snapshot releases.</p>

<p>The source bundle and package files contain all the HTML files and
documentation provided on the web site.</p>


<h3>2.1. Getting released sources</h3>

<p>Every release comes with full sources and these are available from
<a href="http://librdf.org/dist/source/">http://librdf.org/dist/source/</a> master site as well as the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/librdf/">SourceForge site</a>.
</p>


<h3>2.2. Getting nightly source snapshots</h3>

<p>Each night a snapshot distribution is attempted using the current
development sources (that may not even be in the CVS), using the
<code>make dist</code> target of the automake system.  If this target
completes, these snapshots are then made available from:
<a href="http://librdf.org/dist/snapshots/source/">http://librdf.org/dist/snapshots/source/</a>
(binary snapshot releases are also attempted each night from the
same sources).
</p>

<h3>2.3. Getting the sources from CVS</h3>

<pre>
  # sh, bash, ...
  CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.librdf.org:/cvsroot
  export CVSROOT
  # csh, tcsh, ...
  setenv CVSROOT :pserver:anonymous@cvs.librdf.org:/cvsroot

  cvs login
Logging in to :pserver:anonymous@cvs.librdf.org:2401/cvsroot
CVS password: 
  [return]

  cvs checkout bindings

  cd bindings
</pre>

<p>At this stage, or after a <code>cvs update</code> you will
need to create the automake and autoconf derived files, as described
below in <a href="#sec-create-configure">Create the configure program</a>
by using the <code>autogen.sh</code> script.</p>

<p>Building the Redland bindings in this way requires some particular
development tools not needed when building from snapshot releases -
automake, autoconf and swig.
The <code>autogen.sh</code> script looks for the newest versions
of the auto* tools and checks that they meet the minimum versions.</p>



<h2>3. Configuring and building</h2>

<p>Redland bindings uses the GNU automake and autoconf to handle system
dependency checking.  It is developed and built on x86 Linux (Redhat),
but is also used extensively locally on various versions of
sparc Sun Solaris 2.x.  I also test it via
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>s'
compile farm and it builds on Debian Linux (x86, Alpha, PPC and
Sparc, IA64), FreeBSD (x86) and Apple OSX.</p>


<p>Configure tries very hard to find several programs and libraries
that the Redland bindings need.  These include the binding binaries:
perl, python, etc., headers for the bindings such as the JDK, Python etc.
and various others.  A summary of the parts found is given at
the end of the configure run.  Several options to configure given
below can be used to point to locations or names of dependencies that
cannot be automatically determined.</p>


<h3><a id="sec-create-configure" name="sec-create-configure"></a>3.1. Create <code>configure</code> program</h3>

<p>If there is no <code>configure</code> program, you can create it 
by running the <code>autogen.sh</code> script, as long as you have the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/automake.html">automake</a> and
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html">autoconf</a>
tools.  This is done by:</p>
<pre>
  ./autogen.sh
</pre>
<p>and you can also pass along arguments intended for configure (see
below for what these are):</p>
<pre>
  ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr/local/somewhere
</pre>

<p>Alternatively you can run the automake and autoconf programs by
hand with:</p>
<pre>
  aclocal; autoheader; automake --add-missing; autoconf
</pre>

<p>The automake and autoconf tools have many different versions and
at present development is being done with automake 1.8.3 (minimum
version 1.7), autoconf 2.59 (minimum version 2.54) and libtool 1.5.4
(minimum version 1.4).  These are only needed when compiling from CVS
sources.  autogen.sh enforces the requirements.  In future
development will move to require automake 1.8, autoconf 2.58 and
libtool 1.5.</p>


<h3>3.2. Options for <code>configure</code></h3>

<p>See also the generic GNU installation instructions in 
<a href="INSTALL">INSTALL</a> for information about general options
such as <code>--prefix</code> etc.</p>

<dl>

<dt><code>--with-java</code>(=<em>JAVA-COMMAND</em>)<br /></dt>
<dt><code>--with-perl</code>(=<em>PERL-COMMAND</em>)<br /></dt>
<dt><code>--with-php</code>(=<em>PHP-COMMAND</em>)<br /></dt>
<dt><code>--with-python</code>(=<em>PYTHON-COMMAND</em>)<br /></dt>
<dt><code>--with-ruby</code>(=<em>RUBY-COMMAND</em>)<br /></dt>
<dt><code>--with-tcl</code>(=<em>TCL-COMMAND</em>)<br /></dt>
<dd><p>Enable the given language APIs - the default is to build
no language APIs automatically.  If the option value is omitted or
<em>yes</em>, configure will guess the location of the language
command.  If the option value is <em>no</em> or no option is given,
the language API will be disabled - this is the default, not
to build any language API.</p>

<p>If the option is given a value, that is used as the appropriate
language command to use.  For example <code>--with-ruby=ruby1.8</code>
will use the 'ruby1.8' binary, whereas <code>--with-ruby</code> will use
'ruby' as the binary, both of these will be searched for in the PATH.
An absolute path could alternatively be given such as
<code>--with-python=/opt/mypython/bin/python</code> 
to use a python installation in a different location.</p></dd>

<dt><code>--with-jdk=</code><em>DIR</em><br /></dt>
<dd><p>Choose the location of the Java JDK to use for building
the Java API with Java JNI.  If omitted, Redland will guess likely
locations but this is not guaranteed to work.
</p></dd>


<dt><code>--with-redland=</code> <code>system</code> or <code>internal</code><br /></dt>
<dd><p>
This option tells the bindings to use either the system installed version
of <a href="http://librdf.org/">redland</a>
or an internal version, in a parent or sibling directory as
described above.  If the option is omittted, the system one is
prefered, and if none is available, configure will stop.
</p></dd>

</dl>


<h3>3.3 Configuring</h3>

<p>If everything is in the default place, do:</p>
<pre>
   ./configure
</pre>

<p>More commonly you will be doing something like this, indicating
which binding or bindings are wanted:</p>
<pre>
   ./configure --with-python
</pre>

<p>If you are having problems with configuring several times when
adding or removing options, you may have to tidy up first with either
of these:</p>
<pre>
   make clean
   rm -f config.cache
</pre>

<h3>3.4 Compiling</h3>

<pre>
   make
</pre>


<h2 id="sec-testing">3.5. Testing</h2>

<p>You can build and run the built-in tests for Redland with:</p>
<pre>
    make check
</pre>
<p>which will run these tests for the enabled languages.  These
<em>may fail</em> if the main redland libraries (librdf and
raptor, rasqal) are not installed but are used in nearby source trees.
So in this case you should install redland, raptor and rasqal first</p>

<p>The language-specific tests can also be built and run with:</p>
<pre>
   cd language
   make check
</pre>



<h3 id="sec-install">3.6 Installing the bindings</h3>

<p>To install the bindings, do:</p>

<pre>
   make install
</pre>

<p>Otherwise, the language-specific installations can be made with:</p>
<pre>
  cd language
  make install
</pre>



<h2>4. Using the library</h2>

<p>There are many examples for all of the language interfaces in the
corresponding sub-directories such as <code>perl/example.pl</code>
which may be easier to modify.</p>
