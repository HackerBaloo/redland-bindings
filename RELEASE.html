<h1>Redland RDF Application Framework Bindings</h1>

<h2 id="rel0_9_17_1"><a name="rel0_9_17_1">Redland 0.9.17-1 Changes</a></h2>

<p>This is the first release of Redland Bindings separate from
Redland and includes the following changes compared to the language
bindings in Redland 0.9.16</p>

<h3>General Changes</h3>

<p>The main change is to split the API that Redland exports in the
redland package from the language specific parts in the
redland-bindings package.</p>

<p>For most of the language bindings, the interface between them is
using SWIG.  This is now defined by the Redland.i file installed by
the redland package (redland-devel RPMs, librdf-dev debs).  This can
be found via <code>redland-config --swig</code> and then used to
generate the C wrappers for the bindings.  There may be need for
language-specific changes which can be used via #included .i files
triggered by calling swig and the C compiler with defines like
-DREDLAND_PRE_I to #include redland-pre.i from the Redland.i.</p>

<p>The last paragraph does not apply to C# (Redland#) which uses
the built in P/Invoke feature of the language and runtime to call
the Redland functions directly.</p>


<h3>Packaging changes</h3>

<h3>C# API (Redland#) Changes</h3>

<p>This is an entirely new API for 0.9.17 originally created by Cesar
Lopez Nataren &lt;cesar@ciencias.unam.mx&gt;  It was updated by Dave
Beckett to work with the released Mono 1.0 and substantially improved
by Edd Dumbill.  Changes since Cesar's version are given in detail in
the csharp directory ChangeLog but include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Namespace changed from Rdf to Redland</li>
<li>Added marshalling of strings between Redland and Redland#</li>
<li>Freeing of native Redland objects by implementing the C# IDisposable interface, the Dispose method</li>
<li>Query and QueryResults Classes: Added for Redland querying</li>
<li>Added strong naming of Redland.dll</li>
<li>Class Model. Added methods Execute, GetContexts, GetFeature, SetFeature, Load.</li>
<li>Class World. Updated to use new Redland 0.9.17 logging API especially for parsing errors and warnings</li>
<li>Class Parser: ParserError for parsing exceptions</li>
<li>Classes Errors, Locator, LogMessage: Added for wrapping structured
error messages returned from parsing.</li>
<li>Classes Node, Statement, Uri: Added Equals, operator==, operator !=</li>
<li>Classes Stream and Iterator: Fixes for the IEnumerable interface</li>
<li>Class Node: Added methods for types - Type, IsResource, IsLiteral, IsBlank</li>
<li>Class Node: Added method Uri.</li>
<li>Fixed handling of null / IntPtr.Zero in several methods</li>
</ul>



<h3>Java API Changes</h3>
