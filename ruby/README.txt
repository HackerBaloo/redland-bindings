This is ruby-rdf by Dominic Sisneros from http://ruby-rdf.rubyforge.org/
Project info and downloads are at http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruby-rdf/

To use the .gem files you will need the rubygems-0.2.0.tar.gz from
http://rubygems.rubyforge.org/ (or later version)

Then install with:
  gem -i rdf-redland-VERSION.gem

You will also likely need a pretty new version of ruby, the
exact minimum has not been determined yet.  Try 1.8.0
