You will need a pretty new version of ruby, the exact minimum has
not been determined yet.  It has been tested with 1.8.1.

For some modules and the tests files, you need rubygems you will need
rubygems from http://rubygems.rubyforge.org/  It has been tested with
0.3.0

Then 'make check' should run the tests.
